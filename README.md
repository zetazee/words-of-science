# Words of Science

Isaac Asimov has come to my rescue many times in my life in different ways. the most recent one is related to scientific words.  

i was struggling, struggling hard, to teach myself how to read and understand scientific literature. i was feeling less intelligent and far behind my peers, and i thought it was a me problem. during this process, i got my hands on an Asimov book at my university library named **WORDS OF SCIENCE**. it is asimov, so i naturally picked it up and read it. here's how he cured me in a page:  

> AMLOST any specialized field of human knowledge, whether it be carpentry, mountain-climbing, or horse-racing, has its special vocabulary. without a knowledge of that vocabulary, it is difficult to discuss the subject with those who are acquainted with the field. any introduction to the field must, in fact, include as part of the education an explanation of the vocabulary, and a definition of its terms.  

> no specialized field has so large and intricate a vocabulary as has science. it is, indeed, the vocabulary, more than any other aspect of the field, that may give the student the initial concept that science is difficult to understand.  

> entering the world of science turns into a meeting with a whole realm of new words: words that look and sound odd; words that are long and hard to pronounce; words that the ordinary person never meets with in ordinary life. there is coacervate, for instance, and lepidoptera, and diatom, and porphyrin.  

> worse yet, there are ordinary words that one thinks one knows, which somehow take on a new and strange life when used in science. an example is the word ‘work.’ scientists use it to mean motion against a resisting force, so that holding a heavy piece of luggage, motionless, ten centimeters above the ground for two hours, is not work as far as a physicist is concerned, even though you may think it is.  

> worst of all, though the vocabulary of science is huge and intricate, it is never sufficiently huge and intricate to satisfy the scientists of all the various specialties. from year to year, more words are invented to convey new concepts and new discoveries. in 1960, no one had ever heard the words quasar, pulsar, mascon, laser, or transfer-rna. those words did not exist because they represent findings made since 1960.  

> yet it is a shame to allow the scientific vocabulary, enormous, formidable, and continually expanding though it is, to become too difficult a hurdle to overcome. it cannot be made less enormous or forced into a smaller tendency to expand, but it can certainly be made less formidable. one need only look closely at the words in order to see the meaning hidden in them. they will then be found more interesting, more dramatic, more fascinating than anyone would suspect from the mere dictionary definitions.  

i felt like, if asimov was struggling with the exact same things as i do, then i have no excuse whatsoever to complain.  

that is why i decided to make this repository and collect all the words i face in the scientific papers i read.  

the first paper i really read took me 11 hours, the next 10 hours. this will be reduced over time because words and concepts will repeat themselves.  

i will share that progress here.
